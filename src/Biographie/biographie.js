         Hello!

         <br/>
         I'm glad you like my pictures.
         <br/>
         My name is Michael Ntrikos and I was born on 20.11.1980 in Preveza. I then grew up in Germany. 
        At the age of seven I painted my first large picture, a ship in the ocean, which is 1 m x 1.50 m in size. Since that painting, painting has become one of the most important things in my life and it still is for me today. I did not study art. I taught myself all my painting techniques. I also have thousands of pictures in my head that I could paint every day. In my artistic career, I have been inspired by many artists, which has allowed me to develop my own style over the years.
        When I was little, I spent every summer in Parga/Paxos and in Venice with my grandparents. That was a time full of inspiration, where I also painted many other pictures, such as a woman on the beach. All the pictures I paint are very colorful as well as my thoughts and always reflect my mood.
        For this reason, all the pictures I paint are unique. Every picture is a part of me.
        I am very happy if you like my paintings. 
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Best regards
         <br/> 
         <br/>
        Your Michael

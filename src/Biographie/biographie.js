         Hello, nice that you like my pictures.

         My name is Michael Ntrikos and I was born on 20.11.1980 in Preveza and then grew up in Germany. 
          Already at the age of seven I painted my first big picture a ship in the ocean, which was 1mx1,50 m big and since this picture painting has become one of the most important things in my life and it still is for me today. Besides, I didn't study art. In addition, I taught myself all the techniques. I also have thousands of pictures in my head that I could paint every day. In my artistic career, I have been inspired by many artists, which has allowed me to develop my own style over the years.
         When I was little, I spent every summer in Parga/Paxos and in Venice with my grandparents. That was a time full of inspiration, where I also painted many other pictures, such as a woman on the beach. All the pictures I paint are very colorful and my thoughts and always reflect my mood.
         For this reason, all the pictures I paint are unique. Every picture is a part of me.
         I am very happy if you like my paintings. 
         <br/>

         Best regards
         <br/> 
         <br/>
        Your Michael
